                    <p> Hello, my name is David. I'm a Software Engineering student at Centennial College in Ontario. 
                        I've just entered my second year in this advanced diploma program which includes a co-op. Throughout
                        my time in this program I have gained incredibly valuable skills to help me pursue a Software Engineering career.
                        <br><br>
                        Within this program I have been able to work effectively with teams to develop, troubleshoot, and enhance code that we work on.
                        During this work I have been able to develop technicald design documents, undergo the development process, facilitate meetings, and 
                        preset our work to a class of peers.
                        <br><br>
                        Working within the Software Development Life Cycle I have been able to incorporate and learn about such processes as Agile, Waterfall, and Iterative methods.
                        Throughout this program we have worked hands on with programming, testing, and submitting developed projects in such languages as, C#, Java, NodeJS, Javascript, SQL, 
                        and HTML/CSS.
